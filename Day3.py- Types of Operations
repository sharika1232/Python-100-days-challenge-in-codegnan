 # Arithmetic operators:
 
print("sum of two numbers is:", a+b)
print("subtraction of two numbers is:",a-b)
print(" Multiplication of two numbers", a*b)
print(" Division of two numbers", a/b)
print(" Division of two numbers", b/a)
print("floor division of two numbers:", b//a)
print("modulo division of two number:", b% a)
print("power of two numbers:",b**a)

 #Relation operators:
 
print("A is greaterthan B:",a>b)
print("A is lessthan B:",a<b)
print("A is greaterthan or equal to B:",a>=b)
print("A is Lessthan or equal to B:",a<=b)
print("A is Not equals to B:",a!=b)
print("A is double equal:", a==b)

 #logical operator:
 
print(" Add two conditions:",a<b and b<c)
print(" Add two conditions:",a<b and b<c)
print(" Or operator:", a<b or b<c)
print(" Or opreator:",a<b or b<c)
print("Not operator:", b>c)

 #Assigment opreator: (a+=2 -> a=a+2)

a+=40
